# Buffer

Buffers are supports where their skills can **directly boost** the damage of your Main DPS. The buffs can either be from **Elemental Bursts** or **Elemental Skills.** Most of these Skills have **other effects** other than just buffing damage such as Healing, Shielding, Crowd Control etc.

The damage increase can come in the form of either **Increasing** the **Stats** that your characters have which is a **Buff** or **Decreasing** the **Stats** of your enemies which is a **Debuff**. Depending on the characters you use specific character stats can be buffed or specific enemy stats can be debuffed. Some characters **gain the ability** to Buff/Debuff through **constellations.**

The current **character stats** that can be **buffed** by characters is:

* Elemental Damage
* Elemental Mastery
* Physical Damage
* % Attack
* Flat Attack
* Damage
* Critical Rate

The current **enemy stats** that can be **debuffed** by characters:

* Elemental Resistance
* Physical Resistance
* Defence
* Damage
* % Attack
