# Buffer

Buffers are supports where their skills can **directly boost** the damage of your Main DPS. The buffs can either be from **Elemental Bursts** or **Elemental Skills.** Most of these Skills have **other effects** other than just buffing damage such as Healing, Shielding, Crowd Control etc.

The damage increase can come in the form of either **Increasing** the **Stats** that your characters have which is a **Buff** or **Decreasing** the **Stats** of your enemies which is a **Debuff**. Depending on the characters you use specific character stats can be buffed or specific enemy stats can be debuffed. Some characters **gain the ability** to Buff/Debuff through **constellations.**

The current **character stats** that can be **buffed** by characters \(talents/constellations\):

* Elemental Damage
* Elemental Mastery
* Physical Damage
* % Attack
* Flat Attack
* Damage
* Critical Rate

The current **enemy stats** that can be **debuffed** by characters \(talents/constellations\) :

* Elemental Resistance
* Physical Resistance
* Defence
* Damage
* % Attack

{% hint style="info" %}
Some Artifact Sets have **Set Bonuses** which can give the character using the set to be a **Buffer** or **Debuffer**. The most well known example is Viridescent Venerer artifact where its 4-set bonus grants any **Anemo Character** the ability to **Reduce** enemies **Elemental Resistance** depending on the element that's been swirled.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Superconduct Reaction is the only elemental reaction to **debuff** enemies. It reduces **Physical Resistance** by **40%** making it a **must have** reaction for any Teams using a **Physical DPS.**
