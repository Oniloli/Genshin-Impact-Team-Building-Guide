# Survivability

Survivability supports are character that are solely focused on keeping your entire party alive. There are two ways that these characters can increase your party's survivability. The first is **Healing** and the second is **Shielding**.

Healing characters are self-explanatory. These characters have the ability to regenerate the health of other characters in the party.
