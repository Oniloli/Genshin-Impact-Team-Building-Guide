# Crowd Control \(CC\)

Crowd Controls Supports are characters where they have the ability to **control enemy movement**. The CC can either come from their **Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst** or **Reactions**. The enemies affected by the CC are either grouped up into one spot or stop them from doing anything.  
  
There are **three types** of CC. The first type **groups up** enemies, allowing for characters to **perform combos** hitting multiple enemies at once for **massive damage**. This type of CC is common among **Anemo Characters**, and this synergizes well with their ability to **Debuff** enemies. Should be noted that this type of crowd control **works best against smaller enemies**, and the strength of CC depends on the level of the character using CC relative to the level of the enemy. **Larger enemies** like **Mitachurls** and **Ruin Guards** will either **resist** the effects of grouping CC, or **ignore them** altogether.

The second type enemies completely **stops enemy movement.** This leaves enemies helpless and **completely exposed** to any form of damage, but **they can be freed** from the CC depending on the the **damage type/weapon** and what's is used to stop them in place. Large Enemies **can be affected** by this CC rather easily compared to Grouping CC. There are a few variations of this type of CC on different characters.

**Frozen Reaction** \(Hydro + Cryo\) is an **Elemental Reaction** that's focused on CC. Any Teams with a Cryo and a Hydro character in the team will grant the team the freeze enemies. This can affect **every enemy except bosses** meaning enemies who would normally be a threat would be **harmless** so long as they are frozen. The main drawback with the Frozen Reaction is that it **can be easily broken**. Any **other Elemental Reactions** and using **Heavy Attacks** \(Claymore/Plunge Attacks/Explosions/Geo Element\) will break the freeze. With certain Teams Combos you can keep an enemy **permanently frozen** in place.

There is a third form of CC which is **Taunting** and is commonly an **Elemental Skill** for a character. The effect of this CC is to make enemy attacks **focus** on a **secondary object** instead of a character. This CC is **most useful** when **defending objectives** like Monoliths however because they'll be attacking your taunt giving you breathing room to kill enemies in relative safety. The **main drawback** is that it relies on the enemies to **group up themselves** on the taunt, it **isn't as effective** as the other form of CC because it doesn't group up some **ranged enemies** like Hilichurl Archers, and Bosses are **resistant** to taunts.
