# Crowd Control \(CC\)

Crowd Control Supports are characters where they have the ability to **control enemy movement**. The CC can either come from their **Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst** or **Reactions**. The enemies affected by the CC are either grouped up into one spot or stop them from doing anything. There are **three forms** of CC.  


## Grouping

  
The first type **groups up** enemies, allowing for characters to **perform combos** hitting multiple enemies at once for **massive damage**. This type of CC is common among **Anemo Characters**, and this synergizes well with their ability to **Debuff** enemies. Should be noted that this type of crowd control **works best against smaller enemies**, and the strength of CC depends on the level of the character using CC relative to the level of the enemy. **Larger enemies** like **Mitachurls** and **Ruin Guards** will either **resist** the effects of grouping CC, or **ignore them** altogether.

## Immobilization

The second type enemies completely **stops enemy movement.** This leaves enemies **immobile** and **completely exposed** to any form of damage, but **they can be freed** from the CC depending on the the **damage type/weapon** and what's is used to stop them in place. Large Enemies **can be affected** by this CC rather easily compared to Grouping CC. There are a few variations of this type of CC on different characters.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Frozen Reaction** \(Hydro + Cryo\) is an **Elemental Reaction** that's focused on CC. Any Teams with a Cryo and a Hydro character in the team will have the ability to freeze enemies. This can affect **every enemy except bosses** meaning enemies who would normally be a threat would be **harmless** so long as they are frozen. The main drawback with the Frozen Reaction is that it **can be easily broken**. Any **other Elemental Reactions** and **Heavy Attacks** \(Claymore/Plunge Attacks/Explosions/Geo Element\) will break the freeze. With certain Teams Combos you can keep an enemy **permanently frozen** in place.

## Taunt

Taunting commonly comes in the form of an **Elemental Skill**. It directs the **enemies' focus** onto a **secondary object**, relieving your character of damage and creating a pocket of breathing room. This CC is **highly valuable** in defense objectives such as **protect the monolith**.   
  
Taunts rely on enemies to **gather around** the taunt, rendering it **less effective** than other forms of CC due to a taunt's **limited range**. Taunts **do not** affect enemies out of its range \(Hilichurl Archers\) or **Boss enemies**.
