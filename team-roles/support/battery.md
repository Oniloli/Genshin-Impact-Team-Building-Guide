# Energy Battery

Energy Battery Supports are characters where they **give large amounts energy** to the entire party. They will use their **Elemental Skill** which will create **energy particles** when it **hits an enemy** which will fill up the **Elemental Burst** gauge for your entire party.

Some characters can become energy batteries if they use a **Sacrificial Weapon** where it's passive effect is that it has a chance to **Reset Cooldowns** when an elemental skill hits an enemy. **Constellations** also play an effect on a character's viability as an energy battery by giving them an **extra charge** on their elemental skill for example.

When you collect energy particles **certain characters** in your party will gain **more energy** than the others. Characters that are the **matching element** of the particle will gain the more energy compared to those that aren't. Characters that are also on-field also gain more energy than those that are off-field. So if you want a **specific character** to gain the **most energy** from each particle your Energy Battery casts the skill then you **switch** to that character and collect the orbs.
