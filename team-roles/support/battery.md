# Energy Battery

Energy Battery Supports are characters where they **give large amounts energy** to the entire party. They will use their **Elemental Skill** which will create **energy particles** when it **hits an enemy** which will fill up the **Elemental Burst** gauge for your entire party.

Some characters can become energy batteries if they use a **Sacrificial Weapon** where it's passive effect is that it has a chance to **Reset Cooldowns** when an elemental skill hits an enemy. **Constellations** also play an effect on a character's viability as an energy battery by giving them an **extra charge** on their elemental skill for example.

When you collect energy particles



Every character generates a **different amount of energy particles** when casting their Elemental skills except for a select few. The **element of the energy particle** will also **depend** on the **character** that casted the skill eg. \(Cryo character will generate Cryo Particles\). The **more** energy particles are generated the more energy is gained as a general rule of thumb.

**Skill Cooldowns** on Elemental skills can also determine if a character can be a good energy battery or not. Most of the time a **Lower Cooldown** would make a character a better battery. By taking into account both the skill cooldowns and particles generated per cast, the **more Energy Particles per Second** the better the energy regeneration in total.
