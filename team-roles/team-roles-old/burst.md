# Burst Sub DPS \[Old might be deleted\]

This the one of the core roles you can have for your entire party. Burst Sub DPS are characters where their main value lies in their **Elemental Burst support**. Just they work like Burst Main DPS where they would mainly switch in to cast to cast their Elemental burst. They will go through a downtime period where you would **recharge** your **energy** or **wait for Cooldown** until it can be cast again.

The main damage source for a Burst Sub DPS is their **Elemental Burst.** They can be boosted by elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

While Burst Sub DPS can work like a Burst Main DPS, some characters can apply **buffs** to make your Main DPS do even more damage on top of the Burst. This makes them ideal during combos where you use Multiple Elemental Bursts in a specific order to take advantage of the buffs that they bring.

{% hint style="info" %}
You **do not** need to put in a lot of **investment** to make them good a Sub DPS. As long as they can frequently cast their Skills and Burst that is already more than enough for your main DPS. It's recommended to start investing to increase their DPS once your Main DPS gets into a level you are **satisfied** with.
