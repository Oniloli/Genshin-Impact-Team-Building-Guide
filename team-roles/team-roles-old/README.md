# Team Roles \(reference. will be deleted\)

## Main DPS

These are units who are the core of the team. Their main goal most of the time is just to deal damage on the field.

### Types of Main DPS

| Sustained | Burst \(QuickSwap\) |
| :---: | :---: |
| Characters that spends the most time active on the field. The DPS is the main focus of the team. There should only be 1 main DPS in a team. | Characters who deal the majority of their damage in one instance mainly through elemental bursts. They then swap out until their burst is fully recharged. |

## Sub DPS

These are characters that deal damage but in a different way. They usually deal damage while off the field.

### Types of Sub DPS

| Off Field | Burst |
| :---: | :---: |
| Character who deals additional damage with minimal field time. Usually only swapped for their skills off cooldown to set up reactions for the Main DPS. | Characters that deals a great amount of damage via a short combo, usually consisting of skill use and a burst use. Burst supports use their abilities to deal high damage and potentially apply certain effects, then leave the field so the main DPS can take their place. |
| Example characters | Example characters |

## Supports

Supports are off-field characters that offer more than just DPS. They can deal dps but not as much and are more for utility.

### Types of Supports

| Healers | Utility |
| :---: | :---: |
| Characters where their main job is to keep your entire party alive. It can be done through restoring the health of your party or protecting them with shields. | Characters that where their skill set focuses on different effects that can overall increase the DPS of your team comp. |
