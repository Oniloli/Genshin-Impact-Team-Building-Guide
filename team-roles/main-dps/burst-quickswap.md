# Burst \(Quickswap\)

This the one of the two core roles you can have for your entire party. Burst DPS Teams work differently from Sustained DPS Teams where they would output all of their damage in a single instance, and then go through a downtime period where you'd recharge your energy until you are fully ready to output that damage again.

The main source of damage for Burst DPS is mainly their **Elemental Burst** and/or **Elemental Skill**. They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

A Burst Team is more complicated to use compared to a Sustained Team because you would need your supports or other Burst DPS to be be invested and be just as strong as your Main DPS. This is important because when you Main DPS casts their burst skill there will be a downtime where they wont deal alot of damage so that needs to be covered by your other characters in the party until its recharged again. 

The amount on investment you would put in a burst team is higher and thus it's recommended that you'd only start looking into a burst team at around **AR50+** where you have already invested in a previous party before hand.
