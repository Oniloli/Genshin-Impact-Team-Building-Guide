# Burst \(Quickswap\)

This the one of the core roles you can have for your entire party. Burst DPS Teams work differently from Sustained DPS Teams where they would output all of their damage in a single instance, and then go through a downtime period where you'd **recharge** your **energy** or **wait for Cooldown** until you are fully ready to output that damage again.

The main source of damage for Burst DPS is mainly their **Elemental Burst** and/or **Elemental Skill**. They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

A Burst Team is more complicated to use compared to a Sustained Team because you would need your Supports or other Burst DPS to be be invested, and be just as close to being or be as strong as your Main DPS. This is important because when your Burst DPS casts their Skills, the downtime where they wont deal a lot of damage needs to be covered by your other characters in the party until it's ready to be cast again.

Because of amount of **investment** you would put in a Burst DPS Team is **higher** compared to a Sustained DPS Team with the same **level of performance**, it's recommended that you'd only start looking into a burst team at around **AR50+** where you have already invested in a **previous** party beforehand.
