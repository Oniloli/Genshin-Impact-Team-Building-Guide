# Burst \(Quickswap\)

This the one of the core roles you can have for your entire party. Burst DPS Teams work differently from Sustained DPS Teams where they would output all of their damage in a single instance, and then go through a downtime period where you'd **recharge** your **energy** or **wait for Cooldown** until you are fully ready to output that damage again.

The main source of damage for Burst DPS is mainly their **Elemental Burst** and/or **Elemental Skill**. They can be boosted by elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

A Burst Team is more complicated to use compared to a Sustained Team because you would need your Supports or other Burst DPS to be be invested, and be just as close to being or be as strong as your Main DPS. This is important because when your Burst DPS casts their Skills, the downtime where they wont deal a lot of damage needs to be covered by your other characters in the party until it's ready to be cast again.

### Burst Playstyles

The first is one focused on **oneshotting** enemies. This specializes in using **Melt/Vaporize** reactions, and so your team choices are **restricted** because only **certain characters** work in a oneshot team. The DPS downtime after casting skills is huge and so it's generally only recommended to be used against **Single Targets** like bosses. 

The other playstyle is called **Quickswap** and this works **similar** to a **Sustained DPS** Team. This focuses on switching between characters constantly and using their **Elemental Skills/Elemental Burst** back to back for consistent damage. Because of the constant switching of characters, those with a **Low Cooldown** on their skills generally work the best in Quickswap teams. The **team choices** of Quickswap teams is extremely **flexible** as **nearly every character can work**. Team combinations that would otherwise not work in a Sustained Teams would work extremely well with a Quickswap playstyle which makes nearly every character be viable choices.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Because of amount of **investment** you would put in **most** Burst DPS Teams is **higher** compared to a Sustained DPS Team with the same **level of performance**, it's **recommended** that you'd only start looking into a burst team at around **AR50+** where you have already invested in a **previous** party beforehand.

          <li>Hu Tao&#x2019;s <b>Elemental Burst</b> is currently one of the <b>hardest-hitting</b> abilities
            in the game. When built for a Burst playstyle, Hu Tao should <b>prioritize</b> strong <b>Cryo application</b> from
            characters like Ganyu or Kaeya for Melts.</li>
          <li>Despite Hu Tao typically wanting to stay below half HP, Bennett can still
            be a strong option here to apply Pyro for Viridescent Venerer <b>debuffs</b> and
            as an ATK buffer as long as Hu Tao casts her burst while remaining below

          <li>Zhongli&#x2019;s burst is great for both <b>damage</b> and <b>CC</b>, the

            and easy to weave into rotations.</li>
          <li>Zhongli&#x2019;s burst <b>does not</b> require any elemental reaction <b>setups</b> and

            excellent <b>off-field damage</b> for any composition, making him one of

          <li>While the fact that he is a Geo character would normally limit his usability
