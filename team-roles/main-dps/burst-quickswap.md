# Burst \(Quickswap\)

This the one of the two core roles you can have for your entire party. Burst DPS Teams work differently from Sustained DPS Teams where they would output all of their damage in a single instance, and then go through a downtime period where you'd recharge your energy until you are fully ready to output that damage again.

The main source of damage for Burst DPS is mainly their Elemental bursts. They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

A Burst Team is more complicated to use compared to a Sustained Team because you would need your supports or other Burst DPS to be be invested and be just as strong as your Main DPS. This is important because when you Main DPS casts their burst skill there will be a downtime where they wont deal alot of damage so that needs to be covered by your other characters in the party until its recharged again. 

The amount on investment you would put in a burst team is higher and thus it's recommended that you'd only start looking into a burst team at around **AR50+** where you have already invested in a previous party before hand.

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Diluc is a sustained DPS that focuses purely on Pyro damage from each
          part of his kit. His Burst <b>infuses</b> his <b>Normal and Charged</b> attacks
          with <b>Pyro damage</b> and combos well with his Elemental skill in DPS rotations.</p>
        <p>Thanks to his constant Pyro DPS, Diluc scales extremely well with supports
          that can enable a high frequency of Elemental Reactions, typically Vaporize,
          such as Xingqiu, and can be further boosted by supports that boost his
          Elemental Mastery or shreds Elemental resistances.</p>

        <p>Razor is a <b>selfish sustained DPS</b> that focuses primarily on dishing
          out powerful Physical attacks from his Normal Attack chain but also has
          extra Electro Damage in his kit.</p>
        <p>He pairs well with characters who can consistently <b>apply Cryo</b> from
          off-field to keep enemies <b>debuffed with Superconduct</b> such as Qiqi
          and characters who can keep him healthy during his Burst.</p>
        <p>Electro batteries are also a strong option with Razor to give him more
          Burst uptime.</p>

        <p>Klee is a <b>very high-burst</b> Pyro mage who can dish out incredibly high

        <p>Her <b>Normal and Charge</b> attacks <b>scale well</b> with <b>Vaporize</b>,
          making Hydro application supports strong choices with her.</p>
        <p><b>Elemental</b>  <b>buffers</b> and <b>debuffers</b> such as Sucrose can also

        <p>Noelle is a beefy Geo DPS with <b>large AoE attacks</b> who, despite having
          many support elements mixed into her kit, still ultimately plays like a
          main DPS.</p>
        <p>Being a Geo character, she is not reliant on elemental reactions whatsoever
          for her damage and relies more on more straightforward buffer-type supports
          such as Zhongli to increase her damage.</p>
        <p>She is extremely reliant on her Burst to deal damage and as such should
          always be paired with another Geo to act as a battery for her as well as
          grant her Geo Resonance buffs.</p>

        <p>Ganyu is an extremely powerful ranged Cryo DPS who primarily utilizes
          her unique Charged Shot to dish out consistent burst damage.</p>
        <p>Being a Cryo character, she has access to both Freeze and Melt teams,
          Freeze allows her to more easily land Charged Shots and prevent counter
          attacks from enemies when paired with Hydro characters, and Melt teams
          can skyrocket her DPS with consistent Pyro application from characters
          such as Xiangling.</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Hu Tao is a unique Pyro DPS who has access to both extreme sustained DPS
          with her Elemental Skill Charge Attack spam and high Burst damage with
          her Elemental Burst, at the cost of having a higher DPS downtime than most
          other characters in her category and a unique health cost mechanic.</p>
        <p>When built as a sustained DPS, her team compositions are very similar
          to Diluc&#x2019;s as she relies on consistent Hydro application for Vaporize
          procs, making her pair extremely well with Xingqiu and also scales well
          with supports that increase her Elemental Mastery or debuffs enemy Elemental
          resistances.</p>
        <p>Since Hu Tao gains a damage bonus when below half health from her Ascension
          talent, you should typically avoid using dedicated healers that will put
          her over this threshold.</p>

        <p>Keqing is a mobile DPS who can choose to focus on dealing either Physical
          or Electro damage.</p>
        <p>Both of her build paths scale well with direct damage buffs such as resistance
          shreds or generic offensive stat buffs such as Bennett&#x2019;s Burst,
          however Physical Keqing will want a Cryo character in her party for Superconduct
          procs while Electro Keqing will want supports with a focus on Elemental
          shredding or boosting her DPS through reactions such as Electro-Charged.</p>

        <p>Ningguang is a Geo mage who has access to both powerful sustained DPS
          and a strong burst damage rotation.</p>
        <p>Like Noelle, being a Geo character means Ningguang is not reliant on any
          Elemental reactions for her damage and instead relies on more straightforward
          damage buffers such as Bennett and having a second Geo character in her
          party for Geo resonance.</p>
        <p>She can also choose to bring any sub-DPS characters with consistent off-field
          damage such as Fischl to increase the overall team damage output without
          needing to worry about those characters messing up reaction combos.</p>

        <p>Xiao is an extremely selfish Anemo DPS with huge Area of Effect plunging
          attacks who is greatly reliant on his Elemental Burst to dish out damage.</p>
        <p>Xiao is not reliant on any elemental reactions to deal damage and as such
          should focus purely on having direct-buffer supports such as Bennett in
          his party, aiming for Elemental Resonance buffs such as Pyro and Geo resonance
          is also a strong option for increasing his damage.</p>
        <p>Due to Xiao&#x2019;s heavy reliance on his Elemental Burst, an Anemo battery
          is strongly recommended in any Xiao party to increase his particle generation.</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>A Hydro DPS who primarily uses his Elemental Skill when played as a sustain
          DPS to deal rapid melee damage.</p>
        <p>Tartaglia is unique among the DPS that utilize multiplicative reactions
          such as Melt and Vaporize due to the fact that his attacks outside of his
          Burst are rarely the trigger to these reactions, as such he has more options
          for DPS compositions than most other similar DPS.</p>
        <p>A sustained DPS Tartaglia scales well with consistent Electro application
          supports such as Fischl and Beidou for Electro-Charged damage thanks to
          his fast attack rate and also scales well with direct damage buffers such
          as Bennett.</p>
