# Burst \(Quickswap\)

This the one of the two core roles you can have for your entire party. Burst DPS Teams work differently from Sustained DPS Teams where they would output all of their damage in a single instance, and then go through a downtime period where you'd recharge your energy until you are fully ready to output that damage again.

The main source of damage for Burst DPS is mainly their Elemental bursts. They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

A Burst Team is more complicated to use compared to a Sustained Team because you would need your supports or other Burst DPS to be be invested and be just as strong as your Main DPS. This is important because when you Main DPS casts their burst skill there will be a downtime where they wont deal alot of damage so that needs to be covered by your other characters in the party until its recharged again. 

The amount on investment you would put in a burst team is higher and thus it's recommended that you'd only start looking into a burst team at around **AR50+** where you have already invested in a previous party before hand.

|  | **A Hydro DPS who primarily uses his Elemental Skill when played as a sustain DPS to deal rapid melee damage. Tartaglia is unique among the DPS that utilize multiplicative reactions such Melt and Vaporize due to the fact that his attacks outside of his Burst are rarely the trigger to these reactions, as such he has more options for DPS compositions than most other similar DPS. A sustain DPS Tartaglia can choose to utilize Vaporize in concert with off-field sub-DPS such as Xiangling in order to boost her damage, or he can choose to use Electro supports such as Fischl and Beidou to enable consistent Electro-Charged procs. Due to the fact that Tartagliaâ€™s teams typically deal high amounts of mixed elemental damage, Zhongli is an excellent support for him due to his all-element shredding** |
