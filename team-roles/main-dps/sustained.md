# Sustained

This the one of the two core roles you can have for your entire party. In teams with a Sustained DPS they will be characters that will be doing almost all the DMG output in your team. They will deal their damage consistently over time through combos depending on which character you are playing.

The main damage source for a Sustained DPS is normally their Normal and/or their Charged attacks. They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

There are characters where they can perform both a Sustained and Burst role but they typically lean better on one or the other.

        <ul>
          <li>Diluc is a sustained DPS that focuses purely on Pyro damage from each
            part of his kit. His Burst <b>infuses</b> his <b>Normal and Charged</b> attacks
            with <b>Pyro damage</b> and combos well with his Elemental skill in DPS rotations.</li>
          <li>Thanks to his constant Pyro DPS, Diluc scales extremely well with supports
            that can enable a high frequency of Elemental Reactions, typically Vaporize,
            such as Xingqiu, and can be further boosted by supports that boost his
            Elemental Mastery or shreds Elemental resistances.</li>

            out powerful Physical attacks from his Normal Attack chain but also has
            extra Electro Damage in his kit.</li>
          <li>He pairs well with characters who can consistently <b>apply Cryo</b> from
            off-field to keep enemies <b>debuffed with Superconduct</b> such as Qiqi
            and characters who can keep him healthy during his Burst.</li>
          <li>Electro batteries are also a strong option with Razor to give him more
            Burst uptime.</li>

          damage in short amounts of time.</p>
        <p>Her <b>Normal and Charge</b> attacks <b>scale well</b> with <b>Vaporize</b>,

        <p>Being a Geo character, she is <b>not reliant on elemental reactions</b> whatsoever

        <p>Ganyu is an extremely powerful ranged Cryo DPS who primarily utilizes
          her unique Charged Shot to dish out <b>consistent burst damage.</b> 
        </p>
        <p>Being a Cryo character, she has access to both <b>Freeze and Melt</b> teams,
          Freeze allows her to more <b>easily land Charged Shots</b> and <b>prevent counter attacks</b> from
          enemies when paired with Hydro characters, and Melt teams can <b>skyrocket her DPS</b> with <b>consistent Pyro application</b> from
          characters such as Xiangling.</p>

        <p>Hu Tao is a unique Pyro DPS who has <b>access to both</b> extreme <b>sustained DPS</b> with
          her Elemental Skill Charge Attack spam and high <b>Burst damage</b> with
          her Elemental Burst, at the <b>cost of having a higher DPS downtime</b> than
          most other characters in her category and a unique <b>health cost mechanic.</b> 
        </p>
        <p>When built as a sustained DPS, her <b>team compositions</b> are very <b>similar to Diluc&#x2019;s</b> as
          she relies on <b>consistent Hydro application</b> for Vaporize procs, making
          her pair extremely well with Xingqiu and also scales well with supports
          that increase her Elemental Mastery or debuffs enemy Elemental resistances.</p>
        <p>Since Hu Tao gains a <b>damage bonus</b> when <b>below half health</b> from
          her Ascension talent, you should typically <b>avoid using</b> dedicated <b>healers</b> that
          will put her over this threshold.</p>

        <p>Keqing is a mobile DPS who can choose to focus on dealing either Physical
          or Electro damage.</p>
        <p>Both of her build paths scale well with direct damage buffs such as resistance
          shreds or generic offensive stat buffs such as Bennett&#x2019;s Burst,
          however Physical Keqing will want a Cryo character in her party for Superconduct
          procs while Electro Keqing will want supports with a focus on Elemental
          shredding or boosting her DPS through reactions such as Electro-Charged.</p>

        <p>Ningguang is a Geo mage who has access to both powerful sustained DPS
          and a strong burst damage rotation.</p>
        <p>Like Noelle, being a Geo character means Ningguang is not reliant on any
          Elemental reactions for her damage and instead relies on more straightforward
          damage buffers such as Bennett and having a second Geo character in her
          party for Geo resonance.</p>
        <p>She can also choose to bring any sub-DPS characters with consistent off-field
          damage such as Fischl to increase the overall team damage output without
          needing to worry about those characters messing up reaction combos.</p>

        <p>A Hydro DPS who primarily uses his Elemental Skill when played as a sustain
          DPS to deal rapid melee damage.</p>
        <p>Tartaglia is unique among the DPS that utilize multiplicative reactions
          such as Melt and Vaporize due to the fact that his attacks outside of his
          Burst are rarely the trigger to these reactions, as such he has more options
          for DPS compositions than most other similar DPS.</p>
        <p>A sustained DPS Tartaglia scales well with consistent Electro application
          supports such as Fischl and Beidou for Electro-Charged damage thanks to
          his fast attack rate and also scales well with direct damage buffers such
          as Bennett.</p>
