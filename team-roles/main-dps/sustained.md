# Sustained

This the one of the two core roles you can have for your entire party. In teams with a Sustained DPS they will be characters that will be doing almost all the DMG output in your team. They will deal their damage consistently over time through combos depending on which character you are playing.

The main damage source for a Sustained DPS is normally their Normal and/or their Charged attacks. They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

You can increase your dps by making use of **Animation Cancelling.** This means that you can end an animation of one of your attack combos early, giving you less downtime between attacks. A good example would be **Dash Cancelling** where you can cancel an animation of your attack by dashing and immediately attacking right after. This is most common in Ranged DPS typically Archers where they make use it in their aimed shot combos.

There are characters where they can perform both a Sustained and Burst role but they typically lean better on one or the other.
