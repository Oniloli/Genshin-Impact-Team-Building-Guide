# Sustained

This the one of the two core roles you can have for your entire party. In teams with a Sustained DPS they will be characters that will be doing almost all the DMG output in your team. They will deal their damage consistently over time through combos depending on which character you are playing.

The main damage source for a Sustained DPS is normally their Normal and/or their Charged attacks. They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

There are characters where they can perform both a Sustained and Burst role but they typically lean better on one or the other.

| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_aether.png)  Xiao | Xiao is an **extremely selfish** Anemo DPS with huge **AoE** plunging attacks who is greatly reliant on his Elemental Burst to dish out damage.  Xiao is not reliant on any elemental reactions to deal damage and as such should focus purely on having direct-buffer supports such as Bennett in his party, aiming for Elemental Resonance buffs such as **Pyro and Geo resonance** is also a strong option for increasing his damage.  Due to Xiaoâ€™s heavy reliance on his Elemental Burst, an **Anemo battery** is **strongly recommended** in any Xiao party to increase his particle generation. |
