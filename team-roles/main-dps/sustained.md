# Sustained

This the one of the two core roles you can have for your entire party. In teams with a Sustained DPS they will be characters that will be doing almost all the DMG output in your team. They will deal their damage consistently over time through combos depending on which character you are playing.

The main damage source for a Sustained DPS is normally their Normal and/or their Charged attacks. They can be boosted from elemental reactions and/or from their own elemental skills and supports.

There are characters where they can perform both a Sustained and Burst role but they typically lean better on one or the other.

        <ul>
          <li>Diluc is a sustained DPS that focuses purely on Pyro damage from each
            part of his kit. His Burst <b>infuses</b> his <b>Normal and Charged</b> attacks
            with <b>Pyro damage</b> and combos well with his Elemental skill in DPS rotations.</li>
          <li>Thanks to his constant Pyro DPS, Diluc scales extremely well with supports
            that can enable a high frequency of Elemental Reactions, typically <b>Vaporize</b>,
            such as Xingqiu, and can be further boosted by supports that boost his <b>Elemental Mastery</b> or
            shreds <b>Elemental resistances.</b>

            extra Electro Damage in his kit.</li>
          <li>He pairs well with characters who can consistently <b>apply Cryo</b> from

            and characters who can keep him healthy during his Burst.</li>

          <li>When built as a sustained DPS, her <b>team compositions</b> are very <b>similar to Diluc&#x2019;s</b> as

            her pair extremely well with Xingqiu and also scales well with supports
            that increase her Elemental Mastery or debuffs enemy Elemental resistances.</li>
          <li>Since Hu Tao gains a <b>damage bonus</b> when <b>below half health</b> from
            her Ascension talent, you should typically <b>avoid using</b> dedicated <b>healers</b> that
            will put her over this threshold.</li>

          <li>Tartaglia is unique among the DPS that utilize <b>multiplicative reactions</b> such
