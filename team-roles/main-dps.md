# Main DPS

Main DPS is one of the core roles your party can have. They will have the largest contribution to the team's damage output by consistently dishing out damage.

Main DPS' damage source is frequently normal and/or charged attacks, boosted by elemental reactions from their supports.

Compared to a Burst Main DPS Team a Sustained DPS Team doesn't need as much investment to perform well because of their DPS consistency. Sustained Main DPS are also easier to play since you don't have to worry about **Energy** on their Elemental Bursts as much, and their DPS combos are simple and easy to grasp.

Stuff about Selfish dps \(xiao here\) can't be asked to type it for now...

While there are characters that can function as a main DPS or burst support, most typically trend toward one or the other.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to invest in your Main DPS first as they deal the bulk of the team's damage. Supports only require minimal investments \(e.g. getting the recommended Energy Recharge\). Further investment into supports begin once the main DPS' gear is satisfactory to your liking.
