# Off-field

This is one of the playstyles characters have. Off-field Sub DPS are characters that do not spend alot of time on the field and are only switched in for their skills. When they use their skills they will stay active on the field even when the character itself is off-field.

The main damage source for Off-field Sub DPS is mainly their **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst.** Most of these characters will deal very little damage with their normal attacks. Because their skills stay active off-field it makes them perfect for Supporting a Main DPS
