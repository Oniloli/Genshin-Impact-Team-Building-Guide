# Off-field

This the one of the core roles you can have for your entire party. Off-field Sub DPS are characters that do not spend alot of time on the field and are only switched in for their skills. When they use their skills they will stay active on the field even when the character itself is off-field.

The main damage source for Off-field Sub DPS is mainly their **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst.** Most of these characters will deal very little damage with their normal attacks. Because their skills stay active off-field it makes them perfect for **Supporting a Main DPS** by applying elements to create **Elemental Reactions.**

{% hint style="info" %}
You **do not** need to put in a lot of **investment** to make them good a Sub DPS. As long as they can frequently cast their Skills and Burst that is already more than enough for your main DPS. It's recommended to start investing to increase their DPS once your Main DPS gets into a level you are **satisfied** with.

          <li>Xiangling compliments both Hydro and Cryo main DPS characters such as
            Ganyu and Tartaglia for constant Vaporize/Melt procs.</li>
          <li>A Pyro battery is also a strong option with Xiangling due to the high

            as Noelle and Ningguang to grant the team Geo Resonance and add consistent
            off-field DPS with his Elemental Skill.</li>

            well through enabling frequent Vaporize reactions, but can perform well
            even in neutral-element compositions simply through his damage.</li>

            her a strong single-target Sub DPS.</li>

            reactions like Electro-Charged and can double down as a battery for Electro
            DPS such as Razor and Keqing.</li>
