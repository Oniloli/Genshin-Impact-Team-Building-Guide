# Burst

This the one of the core roles you can have for your entire party. Burst Sub DPS are characters where their main value lies in their **Elemental Burst support**. Just they work like Burst Main DPS where they would mainly switch in to cast to cast their Elemental burst. They will go through a downtime period where you would **recharge** your **energy** or **wait for Cooldown** until it can be cast again.

The main damage source for a Burst Sub DPS is their **Elemental Burst.** They can be boosted from elemental reactions or from their own elemental skills and supports.

While Burst Sub DPS can work like a Burst Main DPS, some characters can apply **buffs** to make your Main DPS do even more damage on top of the Burst. This makes them ideal during combos where you use Multiple Elemental Bursts in a specific order to take advantage of the buffs that they bring.
