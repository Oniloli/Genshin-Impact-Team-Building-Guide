# Anemo

{% hint style="info" %}
All Anemo Characters can use a 4-set **Viridescent Venerer.** The effect description in-game says:  
_"Increases Swirl DMG by 60%. Decreases opponent's Elemental RES to the element infused in the Swirl by 40% for 10s."_  
This means that any anemo character can be **Debuffers** and is a must have for almost all anemo **support** characters. **Do not** put this set on an Anemo **Main DPS** as they don't benefit from this set.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
For the Elemental Debuff to **take effect** the character with the set **must be on the field** on the first swirl reaction then switch out after. If you use anemo ability then switch out before the swirl reaction happens it won't activate.
{% endhint %}
