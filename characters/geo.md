# Geo

{% hint style="info" %}
When running a Geo Main DPS. You should always try to aim to have a **2nd Geo Character** in your team because of its **Elemental Resonance.** The in-game description says:  
"_Increases **Shield** strength by 15%. Additionally, characters protected by a shield will have the following special characteristics: **DMG dealt increased by 15%**, dealing DMG to enemies will decrease their **Geo RES** by 20% for 15s."_  
Having this resonance will make your Geo Team **significantly stronger without any extra investment** into weapons or artifacts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only have up to **3 Player-Made Geo Constructs** of any kind in the field at the same time.
