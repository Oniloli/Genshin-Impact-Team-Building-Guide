# Team Dissonance

## **Physical/ Elemental Melee DPSes + Elemental DMG Infusers**

Both Physical and Elemental Melee DPS have anti-synergy with Elemental DMG infusers such as **Chongyun** with his **Elemental Skill** and **C6 Bennett** with his **Elemental Burst**. For example, a **Razor** with a **Physical Damage Goblet** paired with a **Chongyun** is very anti-synergistic. Chongyun’s skill makes Razor do **Cryo Damage** instead of Physical, which is a huge DPS loss. 

## **Venti + Low Reach DPSes**

Venti is a really good CC unit with his burst, however some DPS characters **can’t deal damage** because they **can’t reach the enemies** sucked by Venti’s **Elemental Burst**. For example, **Hutao** can’t actually deal AA damage on enemies sucked by Venti’s burst. An **alternative** is to use **Sucrose** instead of Venti.

**List of characters who can/can’t hit in Venti’s burst :** [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zNRM4xCufwz3oceutoRSGtw0SCiwoGNHhKXPb8enZZM/edit\#gid=0**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zNRM4xCufwz3oceutoRSGtw0SCiwoGNHhKXPb8enZZM/edit#gid=0)

## **Freeze + Geo**

Geo **Shatters** Frozen enemies, which **defeats the purpose** of freezing them in the first place. Geo characters like **Albedo** or **Ningguang** don't do much to a Freeze team.
