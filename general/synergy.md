# Team Synergy

This game revolves a lot around **elemental reactions**, with **amplifying reactions** being the most powerful ones because it **directly multiplies your damage** \(1.5x for reverse Melts and reverse Vaporizes and 2x for Melts and Vaporizes\). This makes it very strong for the current meta.

There are a lot of characters that synergize with each other mainly to take advantage of the elemental reactions implemented in the game. 

**Here are some of the popular ones:**

## **Pyro DPS + Xingqiu** 

A Pyro DPS like **Diluc, Hutao** and **Klee** can take advantage of **Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst**. They will trigger **reverse Vaporizes** often due to how Xingqiu’s burst works \(it applies hydro very quickly and consistently\).   
  
Even though **reverse Vaporize** only has 1.5x damage multiplier if compared to Melt that has 2x multiplier, it’s still better than Melt due to how **elemental gauges** work. You’re going to trigger reverse Vaporizes much more consistently than Melts.

## **Non C6 Bennett + Chongyun** 

Bennett is an **exception** from the other Pyro DPS stated above. Here we are covering a **Melt Pyro DPS Bennett**. Bennett can take advantage of triggering 2x multiplier Melts because his damage is mainly from his **Elemental Skill \(Tap\)**, which has 5 sec cooldown \(and 2.5 sec cooldown while inside his burst circle\).   
  
Chongyun here acts as a **cryo applier** for Bennett, while also providing a huge chunk of damage from his burst since it also can be reverse Melted. His skill **infuses** Bennett’s **Auto Attack with Cryo**, which means, Bennett’s AA will **apply Cryo Element to enemies**, then Bennett can do a **Tap skill** and **trigger Melt**. This is very strong because of the low cooldown on Bennett’s skill, especially while standing inside his burst.   
  
Make sure to **apply Cryo Element to the enemy first** from your AA **before tapping Bennett’s skill**, because you surely can mess up the combo. If you accidentally applied Pyro first from Bennett’s skill, you’re gonna do a reverse Melt instead from Bennett’s infused AA, and that reduces DPS by a lot.

## **Tartaglia + Xiangling**

This team synergy revolves around Xiangling **triggering Reverse Vaporize** instead of Tartaglia triggering it. This happens due to how fast Tartaglia applies Hydro aura on enemies, and Xiangling’s Pyro application can’t keep up, so she’s the one triggering reverse Vaporize instead.  
  
On this team synergy, Xiangling needs to be **decently invested** because she’s doing a huge chunk of damage from her reverse Vaporized burst, meanwhile Tartaglia provides on field Hydro damage. **Tartaglia can also trigger Vaporize on his burst** from Xiangling’s Pyro application.

## **Tartaglia + Fischl** 

Unlike previous team synergies which revolve around amplifying reactions such as Melt and Vaporize, this synergy focuses on **Electro-Charged Reaction**. This **won’t** produce **big numbers** like **Melt or Vaporize** however this synergy does **produce a lot of numbers** on your screen. Fischl is a great electro unit for this synergy.  
  
Fischl’s **C6** makes **Oz attack** while your on field character is also attacking, so while Tartaglia is on the field with his super fast Hydro attacks, a summoned Oz will also deal Electro damage to the enemies. Fishcl’s **2nd Passive Talent** will also activate because Tartaglia will be triggering Electro-Charged.

## **Mona + Bennett + Sucrose \(Oneshot Wonder Trio\)**

This Team right here is a **One Shot Team Buffer/Debuffer**. **Mona’s Elemental Burst** provides **Omen Debuff** on enemies \(additive damage% multiplier\), **Bennett’s Elemental Burst** provides a **huge ATK buff** and Sucrose’s **Passive Talents** enables her to add **50 Flat EM \(1st passive\)** and **20% of her EM \(2nd passive\)** to the party members, also she’s Anemo, so she has access to **4 Viridescent Venerer** artifact set, which reduces **Elemental Resistance**. You can add any Main DPS characters you want to deal **huge damage in a short time frame.**

## **Freeze Ganyu**

This team synergy revolves around Ganyu **constantly freezing enemies** with the help of a Hydro support. Some of the best Hydro appliers currently in the game for Ganyu are **Mona** and **Xingqiu**.

Mona is **one of the best**, if not, the best Hydro support currently for a Freeze Ganyu. While her Hydro aura application is worse than Xingqiu’s, she provides **more AoE with the cost of uptime**. One of her main selling points on this synergy is the **Omen Debuff** from her burst. With some tricks, her **Omen debuff can be extended**, which is a nice thing to have. Also you don’t need to be worried of getting staggered because the enemies will be frozen.  
  
Xingqiu is another good Hydro support for Ganyu, he has much **better uptime** \(but worse AoE\) than Mona’s Hydro application but it’s harder to pull off because you need to **weave in Normal Attacks** every time you do a Charged Shot \(Xingqiu’s burst only procs on Normal Attacks\).

## **Ganyu + Xiangling**

This team synergy revolves around **Ganyu’s Charged Shot triggering reverse Melts** with Xiangling’s Elemental Burst. Ganyu’s already huge multipliers on her Charged Shot will deal even more damage because of her reverse Melting it. Both her **Frostflake Arrow** and **Frostflake Bloom will trigger Melt**. This makes it really strong, **possibly the highest DPS** currently on the game right now. 

This is however **harder to pull off** than a Freeze Ganyu. Currently the best off field Pyro aura applicator is Xiangling with her burst. Xiangling’s burst needs Ganyu to be close to the enemies to actually apply Pyro; this makes her **easily staggered** and **vulnerable to enemy attacks**. However, **this can be prevented** with a decently built **shield support**, preferably Zhongli with his really powerful shields while also providing a **Universal Resistance Shred**.

## **Kaeya + Chongyun + Xingqiu**

Here is another team synergy utilizing **Freeze Reaction**, now revolving around the **free character** Kaeya. You can run a **Cryo DPS** Kaeya with the help of **Chongyun’s Elemental Skill**, which infuses Kaeya’s **Auto Attack with Cryo element**, and **Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst** freezes enemies. Because Kaeya is a **sword-wielding** character, he **doesn’t shatter** frozen enemies unlike Chongyun \(part of the reason a freeze DPS Chongyun doesn’t work\).

## **Turbo Fischl**

Turbo is a mechanic which mainly revolves around Fischl’s **insane energy generation** when **Oz triggers** an **Overload/ Superconduct** reaction \(creates an energy particle for **every** enemy hit\). This enables better stat allocations on your characters from ER to other damage stats.  
  
**Xiangling** with her **Elemental Burst** is very good at **Applying Pyro** for Fischl.

## **Physical DPS + Superconductors**

Unlike an Elemental DPS, a Physical DPS like Razor or Physical Keqing **doesn’t benefit** from 4 Viridescent Venerer **Elemental Resistance Shred**, so they need a **Superconductor** to **reduce** the enemy’s **physical resistance**. Thus you need both a **Cryo** and an **Electro Character** on your team to do this. Some characters also provide Physical resistance shred like Zhongli’s Shield.

## **Xiao + Zhongli**

Xiao has a **similar case** with the team synergy above because 4 Viridescent Venerer set **doesn’t reduce Anemo resistance**. Currently there are only a **few characters** that can reduce Anemo resistance which is **Zhongli's Shields**, a **high constellation Venti** \(C2, C6\), and a **high constellation Jean** \(C4\).

## **Xiao + Interruption Resistance**

Xiao, while being able to deal huge plunge damage during burst, is **vulnerable to interruption mid air**. He can easily be staggered while plunging, thus losing DPS.   
Some characters provide interruption resistance via **Shields** like Zhongli, or without shields like Xingqiu’s **Elemental Skill**, Geo Traveller’s **Elemental Burst** on **C1**.

## **Double Geo**

The newly buffed Geo resonance makes it hard to pass on double geo, especially on **Geo DPS** Teams. Like Anemo, Geo doesn’t benefit from the 4 Viridescent Venerer set, it **doesn’t reduce Geo resistance**. Currently the only way to reduce Geo resistance is by having a team with **Geo Resonance** and also Zhongli’s **Universal Elemental Shred** from his **Shields**.
