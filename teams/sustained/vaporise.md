{% hint style="danger" %}
This is just a **Meta Team Comp Example.** You **do not** have to follow this comp as the meta **constantly changes.** In the end it is encouraged you should play the comp that **you want.**
{% endhint %}

This comp focuses on the **Vaporize Reaction** with Diluc and Xingqiu combo with a focus on **vaporizing** every one of Diluc’s **Elemental Skill Taps** and his **Auto Attacks** when possible resulting in a constant **1.5x Damage Multiplier** on Diluc’s attacks.

## Main DPS 

### Diluc ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) 

Diluc plays as Main DPS role where he spends most of his time on the field. He is a **Pyro DPS** that **primarily uses** his his **Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst** for consistent Damage. The main reason why he works as a Sustained DPS because **when he uses his Elemental Burst** his **auto-attacks \(AA\) become infused with pyro.** This means instead of dealing Physical Damage with his AA he deals Pyro Damage. 

The pyro infusion normally lasts 8 seconds but when he reaches his **4th Ascension** he unlocks his **2nd passive talent** which **increases the infusion by 4 seconds** essentially giving him **100% Pyro DMG uptime**, he also gains **20% Pyro DMG during infusion** further boosting his AA damage. If Diluc has the **4-set Crimson Witch** Artifact set equipped every time Diluc **casts his Elemental Skill** it will give him **extra Pyro DMG.** His Skill can be cast **3 times** which means he can reach **max stacks** on the 4-set bonus.

Because he is a Pyro DPS he does the most damage when he creates **Elemental Reactions.** He relies on the **Reverse Vaporise Reaction** which **multiplies** his damage by **1.5x**, and with a character that can consistently **apply Hydro** like **Xingqiu with his Elemental Burst active**, **every attack** that Diluc does w**ill be be a Vaporize Reaction**. While the Melt Reaction gives Diluc bigger numbers it is **less consistent** which means that it will be **less total DPS** compared to Reverse Vaporize in the long run.

By **increasing** Diluc's **Elemental Mastery** he can **increase the damage multiplier** for his Vaporize reactions. Having an **Anemo Character** with Viridescent Venerer set **swirl Pyro** and/or a have a **Zhongli Shield** active will reduce Pyro Resistance increasing Diluc's DPS further.

        <ul>
          <li>Klee compared to Diluc leans more towards <b>Burst DPS playstyle</b> but
            can still deal great Sustained DPS nevertheless. Klee relies on her <b>Normal</b> and <b>Charged Attacks</b> to
            be <b>Vaporized.</b>
          </li>
          <li>Her main downside is her <b>Elemental Burst.</b> While it is very strong

            Xingqiu during her burst and this can result in<b> lost DPS</b> as <b>Xingqiu will Vaporize instead of Klee.</b>

            can potentially <b>Melt/Vaporize every single attack</b> from Klee during
            her burst which is why she is more <b>Burst orientated</b> compared to Diluc
            because her DPS will decrease as long as Venti&apos;s and Xingqiu&apos;s

        <ul>
          <li>Hu Tao is very close to Diluc as they can both use the same Team comps.
            She mainly uses her <b>Charged Attacks</b> for <b>Sustained</b> DPS and her
            Elemental Burst hits very hard.</li>
          <li>Her <b>Elemental Skill Infuses</b> her <b>Normal Attacks with Pyro</b> while
            Diluc gets his <b>Infusion</b> from his <b>Elemental Burst.</b> They both rely
            on Xingqiu on consistent Hydro Application and Vaporize every attack they
            do.</li>
          <li>The main difference between Hu Tao and Diluc mainly comes down to their <b>individual playstyle</b> and <b>mechanics.</b> When
            Hu Tao uses her Elemental Skill she loses <b>30% of her Current Maximum HP</b> for
            the infusion. Since she relies Charged Attacks for Sustained DPS if she
            isn&apos;t <b>C1</b> she has to be careful with <b>managing</b> her <b>stamina.</b> She
            can however <b>heal</b> when she <b>hits enemies</b> with her <b>Elemental Burst,</b> more
            healing the more enemies you hit.</li>
          <li>When Hu Tao is <b>below 50% H</b>P she gets a <b>DPS increase</b> as her <b>2nd Passive Talent</b> gives
            her<b> 33% Pyro DMG</b> and her Elemental Burst <b>Damage Ratios</b> also
            Increase. Because of her mechanic requiring her to be below 50% HP she
            is the <b>only character</b> that <b>doesn&apos;t work</b> well <b>with Bennet</b> as
            a Sustained DPS.</li>

## Sub DPS

### Xingqiu ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png)

Xingqiu plays a **core role** in **every Sustained Team** with a **Pyro Main DPS.** The reason why he is a **top pick** for **Reverse Vaporize** is because he **applies Hydro very consistently**, more so compared to other characters during his **Elemental Burst**. This makes **Most Pyro DPS** be able to **Vaporize Every Attack.** His Damage with his Rain Swords during his Burst is also very high if he is invested with proper gear. His **Rain Swords** will **only appear** if your **on-field character** does a **Normal Attack.**

Because Xingqiu's Elemental Burst is what makes him so strong it is recommended to have a lot of **Energy Recharge** so you can cast your Elemental Burst **as often as possible**. Having a **Weapon and Sands Artifact with Energy Recharge** is what most people should be aiming for when building Xingqiu.

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mona makes the entire comp play more of a burst playstyle. Compared to
            Xingqiu her Hydro Application isn&apos;t as consistent which results in
            a massive DPS loss sustained wise. Even though her Elemental Skill isn&apos;t
            consistent it does provide some CC because it can taunt enemies.</li>
          <li>Her main strength comes into her Elemental Burst. When she cast&apos;s
            her Elemental Burst it lift up small enemies like how they are trapped
            inside a bubble and applies Omen, which increases the damage enemies take.
            When you use your Main DPS Elemental Burst it will be way stronger because
            of Omen. You also pop her her bubble and that will also deal high Burst
            Damage on top of your Main DPS Burst.</li>
          <li>Omen will expire after 4 seconds of bubble being popped and her Elemental
            Burst costs 80 Energy to cast. This means that there will be a large DPS
            downtime when Mona doesn&apos;t have her burst active.</li>
        </ul>

## Support/Sub DPS

### Sucrose ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_sucrose.png) 

Sucrose serves mainly as a Buffer and a Debuffer in this comp. For the Buffing part of Sucrose it all comes from her Passive Talents. Her **1st Passive Talent** is when she creates a **swirl reaction** any party member that's **matching the element** that got swirled gains **50 Elemental Mastery** \(If Pyro is swirled, only Pyro Characters get 50 EM\) for **8 seconds**. Her **2nd Passive Talent** is when she casts her **Elemental Skill** **every single party member** except her gains **20%** of her **Elemental Mastery** for **8 seconds.** These passives **stack together** and so it also recommended to have extremely **High Elemental Mastery** on her to buff your Main DPS as much as possible.

The Debuffing of Sucrose's kit is her **Viridescent Venerer 4-set artifact**. With a 4-set VV she will **reduce** the **Elemental Resistance** of any **element she swirls by 40% for 10s.** This means if Sucrose uses her Elemental Skill and swirls Pyro on enemies they will lose 40% Pyro Resistance and also Buff your Pyro DPS with more Elemental Mastery at **the same time.**

Her **Elemental Burst** is also very strong because it has the ability to Infuse the element it first swirls with. It also lifts small enemies up into the air and **slowly pulls them** to the **center-point** of her Burst providing strong **Crowd Control** and also **Element Applications** your Main DPS can take advantage of.

        <ul>
          <li>Zhongli acts more as a <b>safer approach</b> compared to Sucrose. He is
            one of the <b>best Support characters</b> in the game because of his <b>shield</b>.
            He is the only Shielder in the game to have a <b>100% uptime</b> on his shield,
            as his shield can be <b>re-cast every 12 seconds</b> while the <b>duration</b> of
            the shield itself is <b>16 seconds.</b> You also gain <b>Interruption Resistance</b> with
            his shield active. This means that attacks that can <b>stagger</b> or <b>knock you back</b> almost
            has <b>no effect</b> at all allowing you to do DPS combos more easily.</li>
          <li>The main thing that makes him extremely powerful and work in most teams
            is that his Shield <b>Debuffs</b> enemies that are close by removing <b>20% Resistance on Everything.</b> He
            Shreds <b>Elemental</b> and <b>Physical Resistance</b> allowing any Main DPS
            to deal more damage while at the same time being safe from harm.</li>
          <li>So while Sucrose can shred more Elemental Resistance, Zhongli can <b>potentially be better</b> for <b>some players</b> depending
            on skill and gear because of the shield tanking enemy attacks and allowing
            you to focus more on dealing DPS.</li>
          <li>His Elemental Burst is also very strong. If you build less on his shield
            and more on damage his Meteor deals massive <b>Burst Damage</b> and at the
            same time any enemy that is hit is <b>petrified</b> for a few seconds allowing
            you to <b>set up</b> strong <b>DPS combos.</b>

## Survival

### Bennett ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

Bennett is the **Main Healer** in this comp, but he also serves as the **Main buffer**. His **Elemental Burst** is what makes Bennett one of the **best support characters** in the game. When he casts his Elemental Burst It creates a **small AoE zone** that provides Buffs and Healing. The **Healing Rate** is higher than any other healer in the game so far although he only starts healing below **70% Maximum HP.**

The Buff that Bennett provides with his Elemental Burst is a **Flat ATK Boost** and it is the strongest buff in the game currently compared to other characters. The **strength** of the Buff can only scales from his **Talent Level, Character Level** and **Base Attack** of his weapon. Attack Stats from artifacts **Do Not** make his buffing stronger. This means that with **minimal investment** Bennett can instantly become extremely good in **almost every team.**

His Elemental Burst also **applies Pyro** to **your character** when inside the **AoE.** This means that if you are hit by Elemental Debuffs from Domains and Abyss you can **cleanse** it and not suffer its effects.

The main downside with this Elemental Burst is that only the **active character** can receive its benefits. So if one of your characters that need healing is off-field you need to **switch** to them so they can get healed. If your Bennet is **C0** you also **lose the ability to Buff** your characters while they are being **healed**. Only when Bennet is **C1** does he **Heal and Buff at the same time.**

Bennet is also one of the **Best Energy Batteries** in the game. His Tap E gives 2-3 energy particles and has it has a **Cooldown** of **5 seconds.** If inside his **Elemental Burst** the **cooldown is halved** allowing him to spam his E Tap non-stop and regenerating a lot of energy for the team.

          <li>Diona works extremely well with Pyro DPS. When you use her Elemental Burst
            she creates a<b> small AoE </b>that <b>applies cryo</b> to enemies while <b>healing</b> at
            the same time allowing to Diluc to periodically <b>Melt</b> instead of Vaporize.
            She can also shield Diluc.</li>
          <li>You also gain <b>Interruption Resistance</b> with her shield active. This
            means that attacks that can <b>stagger</b> or <b>knock you back</b> almost
            has <b>no effect</b> at all allowing you to do DPS combos more easily.</li>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>Jean is a well-rounded support that can work in most teams. Being an<b> Anemo character</b> she
            can both <b>Heal</b> and <b>Debuff</b> (if she has 4-set VV) which can increase
            your character possibilities when building your Team.</li>
          <li>When she uses her Elemental Burst she <b>Burst Heals</b> the <b>entire party</b> by
            a large chunk and leaves an <b>Anemo AoE</b> that heals your active character
            for a <b>period of time</b>. Any Enemy that enters its <b>AoE</b> takes damage
            and also <b>swirls</b> the element that it has.</li>
          <li>Her Elemental Burst also <b>swirls elements</b> applied on <b>your character</b> when
            inside the <b>AoE.</b> This means that if you are hit by Elemental Debuffs
            from Domains and Abyss you can <b>cleanse</b> it and not suffer its effects.</li>
          <li>Her Elemental Skill can also <b>Crowd Control </b>small enemies she can <b>toss the enemy</b> at
            any direction. You can make toss them <b>out of the map</b> killing them
            instantly or <b>high up</b> in the air so they take <b>Fall Damage.</b>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>Barbara is a very good <b>F2P</b> healer for Diluc. When you use her Elemental
            Skill she applies hydro to any enemies that she touches. Every enemy <b>she hits</b> while
            her Elemental Skill is active will <b>heal the entire party. </b>
          </li>
          <li>She can also be a cleanser for the entire party as well because she applies
            hydro to your active character although be careful as it <b>cannot remove Electro Debuffs.</b>
          </li>
          <li>Her Elemental Burst is just a <b>party-wide Burst Heal</b> so it should
            only be used in an emergency.</li>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>Qiqi is the strongest healer in the game as she can keep anyone alive
            almost any time no matter how much damage she or her party takes.</li>
          <li>When Qiqi uses her Elemental Skill it works just like Barbara&apos;s skill.
            She heals the entire party when she hits enemies but what makes her powerful
            is that when she is at 4th Ascension (Level 60) her <b>2nd Passive Talent</b> creates
            a <b>Talisman</b> on an enemy which makes any character hitting said enemy <b>heal themselves</b>.</li>
          <li>When she uses her <b>Elemental Burst</b> she <b>Bursts Heals </b>the<b> Entire Party, deals Cryo Damage</b> to
            enemies and then <b>marks them</b> with the <b>healing Talismans.</b>
          </li>
          <li>The main downside with Qiqi is that outside of Healing she has <b>no Utility</b> whatsoever.
            She she <b>applies cyro infrequently</b> and she <b>doesn&apos;t </b>regenerate
            energy for the team. In <b>late game healing isn&apos;t as important</b> so
            she falls off fast.</li>
