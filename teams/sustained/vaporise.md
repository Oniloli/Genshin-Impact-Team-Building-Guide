# Vaporize

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is just a **Meta Team Comp Example.** You **do not** have to follow this comp as the meta **constantly changes.** In the end, it is encouraged to play the comp that **you want.**
{% endhint %}

This comp focuses on the **Vaporize Reaction** with Pyro DPS and Hydro Support combo with a focus on **vaporizing** every one of Diluc’s **Elemental Skill Taps** and his **Auto Attacks** when possible resulting in a constant **1.5x Damage Multiplier** on Diluc’s attacks.

## Main DPS 

### Diluc ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) 

Diluc plays as Main DPS role where he spends most of his time on the field. He is a **Pyro DPS** that **primarily uses** his his **Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst** for consistent Damage. The main reason why he works as a Sustained DPS because **when he uses his Elemental Burst** his **auto-attacks \(AA\) become infused with pyro.** This means instead of dealing Physical Damage with his AA he deals Pyro Damage. 

The pyro infusion normally lasts 8 seconds but when he reaches his **4th Ascension** he unlocks his **2nd passive talent** which **increases the infusion by 4 seconds** essentially giving him **100% Pyro DMG uptime**, he also gains **20% Pyro DMG during infusion** further boosting his AA damage. If Diluc has the **4-set Crimson Witch** Artifact set equipped every time Diluc **casts his Elemental Skill** it will give him **extra Pyro DMG.** His Skill can be cast **3 times** which means he can reach **max stacks** on the 4-set bonus.

Because he is a Pyro DPS he does the most damage when he creates **Elemental Reactions.** He relies on the **Reverse Vaporise Reaction** which **multiplies** his damage by **1.5x**, and with a character that can consistently **apply Hydro** like **Xingqiu with his Elemental Burst active**, **every attack** that Diluc does **will be be a Vaporize Reaction**. While the Melt Reaction gives Diluc bigger numbers it is **less consistent** and results in **less total DPS** compared to Reverse Vaporize in the long run.

By **increasing** Diluc's **Elemental Mastery** he can **increase the damage multiplier** for his Vaporize reactions. Having an **Anemo Character** with Viridescent Venerer set **swirl Pyro** and/or a have a **Zhongli Shield** active will reduce Pyro Resistance increasing Diluc's DPS further.

            Elemental Burst hits very hard.</li>
          <li>Her <b>Elemental Skill Infuses</b> her <b>Normal Attacks with Pyro</b> while

            do.</li>
          <li>The main difference between Hu Tao and Diluc mainly comes down to their <b>individual playstyle</b> and <b>mechanics.</b> When
            Hu Tao uses her Elemental Skill she loses <b>30% of her Current Maximum HP</b> for
            the infusion. Since she relies Charged Attacks for Sustained DPS if she
            isn&apos;t <b>C1</b> she has to be careful with <b>managing</b> her <b>stamina.</b> She
            can however <b>heal</b> when she <b>hits enemies</b> with her <b>Elemental Burst,</b> more
            healing the more enemies you hit.</li>
          <li>When Hu Tao is <b>below 50% H</b>P she gets a <b>DPS increase</b> as her <b>2nd Passive Talent</b> gives

            Increase. Because of her mechanic requiring her to be below 50% HP she
            is the <b>only character</b> that <b>doesn&apos;t work</b> well <b>with Bennet</b> as

## Sub DPS

### Xingqiu ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png)

Xingqiu plays a **core role** in **every Sustained Team** with a **Pyro Main DPS.** The reason why he is a **top pick** for **Reverse Vaporize** is because he **applies Hydro very consistently**, more so compared to other characters during his **Elemental Burst**. This makes **Most Pyro DPS** be able to **Vaporize Every Attack.** His Damage with his Rain Swords during his Burst is also very high if he is invested with proper gear. His **Rain Swords** will **only appear** if your **on-field character** does a **Normal Attack.**

Because Xingqiu's Elemental Burst is what makes him so strong it is recommended to have a lot of **Energy Recharge** so you can cast your Elemental Burst **as often as possible**. Having a **Weapon and Sands Artifact with Energy Recharge** is what most people should be aiming for when building Xingqiu.

          <li>Her <b>main strength</b> comes from her <b>Elemental Burst</b>. When she

            will be <b>way stronger</b> because of Omen. You also pop her bubble and

          <li>Omen will expire after <b>4 seconds </b>of bubble being popped and her

## Support/Sub DPS

### Sucrose ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_sucrose.png) 

Sucrose serves mainly as a Buffer and a Debuffer in this comp. For the Buffing part of Sucrose it all comes from her Passive Talents. Her **1st Passive Talent** is when she creates a **swirl reaction** any party member that's **matching the element** that got swirled gains **50 Elemental Mastery** \(If Pyro is swirled, only Pyro Characters get 50 EM\) for **8 seconds**. Her **2nd Passive Talent** is when she casts her **Elemental Skill** **every single party member** except her gains **20%** of her **Elemental Mastery** for **8 seconds.** These passives **stack together** and so it also recommended to have extremely **High Elemental Mastery** on her to buff your Main DPS as much as possible.

The Debuffing of Sucrose's kit is her **Viridescent Venerer 4-set artifact**. With a 4-set VV she will **reduce** the **Elemental Resistance** of any **element she swirls by 40% for 10s.** This means if Sucrose uses her Elemental Skill and swirls Pyro on enemies they will lose 40% Pyro Resistance and also Buff your Pyro DPS with more Elemental Mastery at **the same time.**

Her **Elemental Burst** is also very strong because it has the ability to Infuse the element it first swirls with. It also lifts small enemies up into the air and **slowly pulls them** to the **center-point** of her Burst providing strong **Crowd Control** and also **Element Applications** your Main DPS can take advantage of.

          </li>
          <li>His shield&apos;s main benefit besides shielding is the Resistance Reduction.
            Enemies near Zhongli&apos;s shield receive a <b>20% Resistance Reduction to all types of damage.</b> It&apos;s
            also the only shield in the game that has 100% uptime. It can be <b>re-cast</b> every <b>12 seconds</b> and

## Survival

### Bennett ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

Bennett is the **Main Healer** in this comp, but he also serves as the **Main buffer**. His **Elemental Burst** is what makes Bennett one of the **best support characters** in the game. When he casts his Elemental Burst It creates a **small AoE zone** that provides Buffs and Healing. The **Healing Rate** is higher than any other healer in the game so far although he only starts healing below **70% Maximum HP.**

The Buff that Bennett provides with his Elemental Burst is a **Flat ATK Boost** and it is the strongest buff in the game currently compared to other characters. The **strength** of the Buff can only scales from his **Talent Level, Character Level** and **Base Attack** of his weapon. Attack Stats from artifacts **Do Not** make his buffing stronger. This means that with **minimal investment** Bennett can instantly become extremely good in **almost every team.**

His Elemental Burst also **applies Pyro** to **your character** when inside the **AoE.** This means that if you are hit by Elemental Debuffs from Domains and Abyss you can **cleanse** it and not suffer its effects.

The main downside with this Elemental Burst is that only the **active character** can receive its benefits. So if one of your characters that need healing is off-field you need to **switch** to them so they can get healed. If your Bennet is **C0** you also **lose the ability to Buff** your characters while they are being **healed**. Only when Bennet is **C1** does he **Heal and Buff at the same time.**

Bennet is also one of the **Best Energy Batteries** in the game. His Tap E gives 2-3 energy particles and has it has a **Cooldown** of **5 seconds.** If inside his **Elemental Burst** the **cooldown is halved** allowing him to spam his E Tap non-stop regenerating a lot of energy for the team.

            the same time allowing to Diluc to periodically <b>Melt</b> instead of Vaporize.
            She can also shield Diluc.</li>
          <li>You also gain <b>Interruption Resistance</b> with her shield active. This
            means that attacks that can <b>stagger</b> or <b>knock you back</b> almost

          <li>Jean is a well-rounded support that can work in most teams. Being an<b> Anemo character</b> she
            can both <b>Heal</b> and <b>Debuff</b> (if she has 4-set VV) which can increase
            your character possibilities when building your Team.</li>
          <li>When she uses her Elemental Burst she <b>Burst Heals</b> the <b>entire party</b> by
            a large chunk and leaves an <b>Anemo AoE</b> that heals your active character
            for a <b>period of time</b>. Any Enemy that enters its <b>AoE</b> takes damage
            and also <b>swirls</b> the element that it has.</li>
          <li>Her Elemental Burst also <b>swirls elements</b> applied on <b>your character</b> when
            inside the <b>AoE.</b> This means that if you are hit by Elemental Debuffs
            from Domains and Abyss you can <b>cleanse</b> it and not suffer its effects.</li>
          <li>Her Elemental Skill can also <b>Crowd Control </b>small enemies as she
            can <b>toss the enemy</b> at any direction. You can make toss them <b>out of the map</b> killing
            them instantly or <b>high up</b> in the air so they take <b>Fall Damage.</b>

            her Elemental Skill is active will <b>heal the entire party. </b>

          <li>She can also be a cleanser for the entire party as well because she applies

          <li>Her Elemental Burst is just a <b>party-wide Burst Heal</b> so it should

        <ul>
          <li>Qiqi is the <b>strongest healer</b> in the game as she can keep anyone alive
            at almost any time no matter how much damage she or her party takes.</li>
          <li>When Qiqi uses her Elemental Skill it works just like Barbara&apos;s skill.
            She heals the entire party when she hits enemies but what makes her powerful
            is that when she is at 4th Ascension (Level 60-70) her <b>2nd Passive Talent</b> creates
            a <b>Talisman</b> on an enemy which makes any character hitting said enemy <b>heal themselves</b>.</li>

          <li>The main downside with Qiqi is that outside of Healing she has <b>no Utility</b> whatsoever.
            She she <b>applies cyro infrequently</b> and she <b>doesn&apos;t </b>regenerate
            energy for the team. In <b>late game healing isn&apos;t as important</b> so
            she falls off fast.</li>

## Damage Rotation

With all of your characters Elemental Bursts fully charged the initial damage rotation will be:  
  
Sucrose Burst &gt; Bennett Burst &gt; Sucrose Skill &gt; Xingqiu Burst &gt; Xinqiu Skill &gt; Diluc Burst &gt; Diluc Skill/Normal attack combo

* First you cast Sucrose's Elemental Burst. It has an **Activation Delay** because she throws a bottle on the ground which summons the attack. This allows you to apply an element before the first hit.
* You then use Bennett's Elemental Burst hitting the enemy and applying pyro for Sucrose's Burst which will then infuse with.
* Quickly switch back to Sucrose and use her Elemental Skill. She will buff her team with Elemental Mastery and if she has a 4-set VV equipped she will also reduce the enemies Pyro Resistance by 40%.
* Cast Xingqiu's Elemental Burst and then cast is Elemental Skill. Since Sucrose's Burst is still active his E will Vaporize multiplying it's Damage by 2.0x.
* Cast Diluc's Elemental Burst to infuse his Normal Attacks with Pyro. Sucrose's Burst will have expired before hand. Be sure that there is Hydro applied on the Enemy before casting his bust.
* You then start using Diluc's Elemental Skill/Normal Attack Weave combo.

Diluc's Elemental Skill/Normal Attack combo is as follows:  
A = 1 Normal Attack  
E = Elemental Skill

* A &gt; E &gt; AA &gt; E &gt; AA &gt; E &gt; AA

You use 2 Normal Attacks after each Elemental Skill to ensure that Hydro Applications are consistent, vaporizing every single hit from his normal attacks and elemental skills.
