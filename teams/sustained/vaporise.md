## Main DPS 

### Diluc ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) 

Diluc plays as Main DPS role where he spends most of his time on the field. He is a **Pyro DPS** that **primarily uses** his his **Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst** for consistent Damage. The main reason why he works as a Sustained DPS because **when he uses his Elemental Burst** his **auto-attacks \(AA\) become infused with pyro.** This means instead of dealing Physical Damage with his AA he deals Pyro Damage. 

The pyro infusion normally lasts 8 seconds but when he reaches his **4th Ascension** he unlocks his **2nd passive talent** which **increases the infusion by 4 seconds** essentially giving him **100% Pyro DMG uptime**, he also gains **20% Pyro DMG during infusion** further boosting his AA damage. If Diluc has the **4-set Crimson Witch** Artifact set equipped every time Diluc **casts his Elemental Skill** it will give him **extra Pyro DMG.** His Skill can be cast **3 times** which means he can reach **max stacks** on the 4-set bonus.

Because he is a Pyro DPS he does the most damage when he creates **Elemental Reactions.** He relies on the **Reverse Vaporise Reaction** which **multiplies** his damage by **1.5x**, and with a character that can consistently **apply Hydro** like **Xingqiu with his Elemental Burst active**, **every attack** that Diluc does w**ill be be a Vaporize Reaction**. While the Melt Reaction gives Diluc bigger numbers it is **less consistent** which means that it will be **less total DPS** compared to Reverse Vaporize in the long run.

By **increasing** Diluc's **Elemental Mastery** he can **increase the damage multiplier** for his Vaporize reactions. Having an **Anemo Character** with Viridescent Venerer set **swirl Pyro** and/or a have a **Zhongli Shield** active will reduce Pyro Resistance increasing Diluc's DPS further.

          <li>Klee compared to Diluc leans more towards <b>Burst DPS playstyle</b> but
            can still deal great Sustained DPS nevertheless. Klee relies on her <b>Normal</b> and <b>Charged Attacks</b> to
            be <b>Vaporized.</b>
          </li>
          <li>Her main downside is her <b>Elemental Burst.</b> While it is very strong
            Xingqiu <b>cannot keep up</b> with Klee because <b>she applies Pyro faster</b> than
            Xingqiu during her burst and this can result in<b> lost DPS</b> as <b>Xingqiu will Vaporize instead of Klee.</b> 
          </li>
          <li>However if you have a <b>Venti</b> with a <b>Hydro/Cryo Infused Elemental Burst</b> you
            can potentially <b>Melt/Vaporize every single attack</b> from Klee during
            her burst which is why she is more <b>Burst orientated</b> compared to Diluc
            because her DPS will decrease as long as Venti&apos;s and Xingqiu&apos;s
            Elemental Burst isn&apos;t active at the same time.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Hu Tao is very close to Diluc as they can both use the same Team comps.
            She mainly uses her <b>Charged Attacks</b> for <b>Sustained</b> DPS and her
            Elemental Burst hits very hard.</li>
          <li>Her <b>Elemental Skill Infuses</b> her <b>Normal Attacks with Pyro</b> while
            Diluc gets his <b>Infusion</b> from his <b>Elemental Burst.</b> They both rely
            on Xingqiu on consistent Hydro Application and Vaporize every attack they
            do.</li>
          <li>The main difference between Hu Tao and Diluc mainly comes down to their <b>individual playstyle</b> and <b>mechanics.</b> When
            Hu Tao uses her Elemental Skill she loses <b>30% of her Current Maximum HP</b> for
            the infusion. Since she relies Charged Attacks for Sustained DPS if she
            isn&apos;t <b>C1</b> she has to be careful with <b>managing</b> her <b>stamina.</b> She
            can however <b>heal</b> when she <b>hits enemies</b> with her <b>Elemental Burst,</b> more
            healing the more enemies you hit.</li>
          <li>When Hu Tao is <b>below 50% H</b>P she gets a <b>DPS increase</b> as her <b>2nd Passive Talent</b> gives
            her<b> 33% Pyro DMG</b> and her Elemental Burst <b>Damage Ratios</b> also
            Increase. Because of her mechanic requiring her to be below 50% HP she
            is the <b>only character</b> that <b>doesn&apos;t work</b> well <b>with Bennet</b> as
            a Sustained DPS.</li>

## Sub DPS

### Xingqiu ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png)

Xingqiu plays a **core role** in **every Sustained Team** with a **Pyro Main DPS.** The reason why he is a **top pick** for **Reverse Vaporize** is because he **applies Hydro very consistently**, more so compared to other characters during his **Elemental Burst**. This makes **Most Pyro DPS** be able to **Vaporize Every Attack.** His Damage with his Rain Swords during his Burst is also very high if he is invested with proper gear. His **Rain Swords** will **only appear** if your **on-field character** does a **Normal Attack.**

Because Xingqiu's Elemental Burst is what makes him so strong it is recommended to have a lot of **Energy Recharge** so you can cast your Elemental Burst **as often as possible**. Having a **Weapon and Sands Artifact with Energy Recharge** is what most people should be aiming for when building Xingqiu.

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mona makes the entire comp play more of a burst playstyle. Compared to
            Xingqiu her Hydro Application isn&apos;t as consistent which results in
            a massive DPS loss sustained wise. Even though her Elemental Skill isn&apos;t
            consistent it does provide some CC because it can taunt enemies.</li>
          <li>Her main strength comes into her Elemental Burst. When she cast&apos;s
            her Elemental Burst it lift up small enemies like how they are trapped
            inside a bubble and applies Omen, which increases the damage enemies take.
            When you use your Main DPS Elemental Burst it will be way stronger because
            of Omen. You also pop her her bubble and that will also deal high Burst
            Damage on top of your Main DPS Burst.</li>
          <li>Omen will expire after 4 seconds of bubble being popped and her Elemental
            Burst costs 80 Energy to cast. This means that there will be a large DPS
            downtime when Mona doesn&apos;t have her burst active.</li>

## Support/Sub DPS

### Sucrose ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_sucrose.png) 

Sucrose serves mainly as a Buffer and a Debuffer in this comp. For the Buffing part of Sucrose it all comes from her Passive Talents. Her **1st Passive Talent** is when she creates a **swirl reaction** any party member that's **matching the element** that got swirled gains **50 Elemental Mastery** \(If Pyro is swirled, only Pyro Characters get 50 EM\) for **8 seconds**. Her **2nd Passive Talent** is when she casts her **Elemental Skill** **every single party member** except her gains **20%** of her **Elemental Mastery** for **8 seconds.** These passives **stack together** and so it also recommended to have extremely **High Elemental Mastery** on her to buff your Main DPS as much as possible.

The Debuffing of Sucrose's kit is her **Viridescent Venerer 4-set artifact**. With a 4-set VV she will **reduce** the **Elemental Resistance** of any **element she swirls by 40% for 10s.** This means if Sucrose uses her Elemental Skill and swirls Pyro on enemies they will lose 40% Pyro Resistance and also Buff your Pyro DPS with more Elemental Mastery at **the same time.**

Her **Elemental Burst** is also very strong because it has the ability to Infuse the element it first swirls with. It also lifts small enemies up into the air and **slowly pulls them** to the **center-point** of her Burst providing strong **Grouping CC** and also **Elemental Applications** your Main DPS can take advantage of.

## Survival

### Bennett ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

Bennett is the **Main Healer** in this comp, but he also serves as the **Main buffer**. His **Elemental Burst** is what makes Bennett one of the **best support characters** in the game. When he casts his Elemental Burst It creates a **small AoE zone** that provides Buffs and Healing. The **Healing Rate** is higher than any other healer in the game so far although he only starts healing below **70% Maximum HP.**

The Buff that Bennett provides with his Elemental Burst is a **Flat ATK Boost** and it is the strongest buff in the game currently compared to other characters. The **strength** of the Buff can only scales from his **Talent Level, Character Level** and **Base Attack** of his weapon. Attack Stats from artifacts **Do Not** make his buffing stronger. This means that with **minimal investment** Bennett can instantly become extremely good in **almost every team.**

His Elemental Burst also **applies Pyro** to **your character** when inside the **AoE.** This means that if you are hit by Elemental Debuffs from Domains and Abyss you can **cleanse** it and not suffer its effects.

The main downside with this Elemental Burst is that only the **active character** can receive its benefits. So if one of your characters that need healing is off-field you need to **switch** to them so they can get healed. If your Bennet is **C0** you also **lose the ability to Buff** your characters while they are being **healed**. Only when Bennet is **C1** does he **Heal and Buff at the same time.**

Bennet is also one of the **Best Energy Batteries** in the game. His Tap E gives 2-3 energy particles and has it has a **Cooldown** of **5 seconds.** If inside his **Elemental Burst** the **cooldown is halved** allowing him to spam his E Tap non-stop and regenerating a lot of energy for the team.
