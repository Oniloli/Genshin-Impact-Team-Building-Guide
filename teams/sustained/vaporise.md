## Main DPS 

### Diluc ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) 

Diluc plays as Main DPS role where he spends most of his time on the field. He is a **Pyro DPS** that **primarily uses** his his **Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst** for consistent Damage. The main reason why he works as a Sustained DPS because **when he uses his Elemental Burst** his **auto-attacks \(AA\) become infused with pyro.** This means instead of dealing Physical Damage with his AA he deals Pyro Damage. 

The pyro infusion normally lasts 8 seconds but when he reaches his **4th Ascension** he unlocks his **2nd passive talent** which **increases the infusion by 4 seconds** essentially giving him **100% Pyro DMG uptime**, he also gains **20% Pyro DMG during infusion** further boosting his AA damage. If Diluc has the **4-set Crimson Witch** Artifact set equipped every time Diluc **casts his Elemental Skill** it will give him **extra Pyro DMG.** His Skill can be cast **3 times** which means he can reach **max stacks** on the 4-set bonus.

Because he is a Pyro DPS he does the most damage when he creates **Elemental Reactions.** He relies on the **Reverse Vaporise Reaction** which **multiplies** his damage by **1.5x**, and with a character that can consistently **apply Hydro** like **Xingqiu with his Elemental Burst active**, **every attack** that Diluc does w**ill be be a Vaporize Reaction**. While the Melt Reaction gives Diluc bigger numbers it is **less consistent** which means that it will be **less total DPS** compared to Reverse Vaporize in the long run.

By **increasing** Diluc's **Elemental Mastery** he can **increase the damage multiplier** for his Vaporize reactions. Having an **Anemo Character** with Viridescent Venerer set **swirl Pyro** and/or a have a **Zhongli Shield** active will reduce Pyro Resistance increasing Diluc's DPS further.

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <ul>
          <li>Klee compared to Diluc leans more towards <b>Burst DPS playstyle</b> but
            can still deal great Sustained DPS nevertheless. Klee relies on her <b>Normal</b> and <b>Charged Attacks</b> to
            be <b>Vaporized.</b>
          </li>
          <li>Her main downside is her <b>Elemental Burst.</b> While it is very strong
            Xingqiu <b>cannot keep up</b> with Klee because <b>she applies Pyro faster</b> than
            Xingqiu during her burst and this can result in<b> lost DPS</b> as <b>Xingqiu will Vaporize instead of Klee.</b> 
          </li>
          <li>However if you have a <b>Venti</b> with a <b>Hydro/Cryo Infused Elemental Burst</b> you
            can potentially <b>Melt/Vaporize every single attack</b> from Klee during
            her burst which is why she is more <b>Burst orientated</b> compared to Diluc
            because her DPS will decrease as long as Venti&apos;s and Xingqiu&apos;s
            Elemental Burst isn&apos;t active at the same time.</li>

## Sub DPS

### Xingqiu ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png)

Xingqiu plays a **core role** in **every Sustained Team** with a **Pyro Main DPS.** The reason why he is a **top pick** for **Reverse Vaporize** is because he **applies Hydro very consistently**, more so compared to other characters during his **Elemental Burst**. This makes **Most Pyro DPS** be able to **Vaporize Every Attack.** His Damage with his Rain Swords during his Burst is also very high if he is invested with proper gear. His **Rain Swords** will **only appear** if your **on-field character** does a **Normal Attack.**

Because Xingqiu's Elemental Burst is what makes him so strong it is recommended to have a lot of **Energy Recharge** so you can cast your Elemental Burst **as often as possible**. Having a **Weapon and Sands Artifact with Energy Recharge** is what most people should be aiming for when building Xingqiu.

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mona makes the entire comp play more of a burst playstyle. Compared to
            Xingqiu her Hydro Application isn&apos;t as consistent which results in
            a massive DPS loss sustained wise. Even though her Elemental Skill isn&apos;t
            consistent it does provide some CC because it can taunt enemies.</li>
          <li>Her main strength comes into her Elemental Burst. When she cast&apos;s
            her Elemental Burst it lift up small enemies like how they are trapped
            inside a bubble and applies Omen, which increases the damage enemies take.
            When you use your Main DPS Elemental Burst it will be way stronger because
            of Omen. You also pop her her bubble and that will also deal high Burst
            Damage on top of your Main DPS Burst.</li>
          <li>Omen will expire after 4 seconds of bubble being popped and her Elemental
            Burst costs 80 Energy to cast. This means that there will be a large DPS
            downtime when Mona doesn&apos;t have her burst active.</li>
        </ul>
